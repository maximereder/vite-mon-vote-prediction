## ℹ About the projet :
This project aims to study the opinion of the population of Grand Nancy (France) on a few specific questions. This study is part of a student project allowing to visualize a project proposed by the city.
This study makes it possible to feed the software for the thesis with real data.

This document will help me to put the data pipeline into production for the new software. Indeed, all the parts will be reused except the data visualization part.

## ℹ About the data:

Several pieces of information are necessary to take into account to understand the data set. 

We have created a google forms to collect the votes of each person.
A QR code has been specially created so that everyone can access it quickly.

The objective was to collect people's opinions without favoring a particular social category. However, the help from the university (email bank) raises awareness among people i.e students have been more affected overall.

24 QR codes have been displayed at points of interest in Grand Nancy.

Data was retrieved in parallel from multiple locations :

*   Our school,
*   Nancy city centre,
*   Essey-lès-Nancy,
*   Saint-Max,
*   Laxou.

The survey was also shared on social networks like Facebook. However, it was difficult to recover a lot of data because our networks cannot recover thousands of data. This justifies the rather low number of votes.
